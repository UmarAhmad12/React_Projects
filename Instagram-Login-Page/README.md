# In this Project, I have created a user page similar to Instagram using React functionalities. The primary task is to implement conditional rendering, allowing users to either sign up or log in depending on their choice. The user interface should show different input fields based on their selection. If they choose to sign up, additional inputs for registration will be displayed. On the other hand, if they opt for login, only the basic username and password inputs should be visible.
